			 "ShortCut" is a game based on Shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm and Bellmanford algorithm.<br>
			 <br>
			 In this game the user is supposed to find the shortest path between the source and destination.<br>
			 <br>
			 Initially there will be two verices marked as source and destination. You can mark path by clicking on vertices.<br>
			 After the path is completed, The best path will be shown and if your matches with the best path you will be passed to next level.
			 Otherwise you have to play the same level again.<br>
			 <br>
			 Scoring is based on both time elapsed as well as no of penalty attempts.<br>
			 Level1 and Level2 will have all positive edges and in Level3 some negative edges are included<br>
